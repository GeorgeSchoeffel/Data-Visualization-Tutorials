Brief Data Visualization Tutorial Featuring Spider Plots and KNN Visualizations

In this repository are four files. There are two files for each data visualization tutorial: one that contains a write up that includes images and another that contains the source code for the images and machine learning algorithms. The writeups are in PDF format, while the source code are contained in the Jupyter Notebook and R script.
